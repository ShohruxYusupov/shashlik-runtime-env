Plan:


Shashlik_Runner:
 - starts emulator
 - install all pending APKs (and remove them from temp dir
 - start passed product

Dolphin installer / Service menu to install
  - adds .desktop entry with package name
  - copies APK to temp folder
  - exec=shashlik_runner product.name
  - check SDK version - warn if problem

  bit of python or full Qt app?
